          <h2>about</h2>
          <p class="int">I'm the one and only Mercy.I was born in February,23,2003 in Addisababa.when I turned three I joined
             school until today I never skipped and flunked.Now I pursue software engineering course in MAU.On my 
             studies,I gained practical experience through a lot of projects.as far as I know my strongest 
             trait is I'm fast learner,I'm good at organizing and attention to detail besides this when I get error in 
             the line of code it's drives me crazy I think it's my weakest trait and I know this is a temporary 
             problem cuz I'm working hard on it.My short time goal is to find a position where I can use my skill 
             and knowledge in a professional setting.I wanted to make a career out of my hobby and so I decided to 
             pursue it with all my determination.</p>
